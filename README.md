OpenSonora Alpha is a high efficiency class-D, low-power bluetooth
wireless speaker that follows a non-conventional design.

\

OpenSonora Alpha sports bottom-facing speakers to produce a distributed
sound effect. Moreover, its design allows to use the top plate as a sort
of a shelf, which can be usefull f.eg. If it's placed on a on a desktop.

\

If the sound quality does not meet your taste though, it's possible to
rotate OpenSonora and use it as a standard shelf speaker.

\

In it original implementation, OpenSonora uses reused/regenerated
components, such as pallet/reused wood, recovered speakers and discrete
electronics components taken from old devices (broken TVs, HiFi,
Radios). It pairs these elements with brand new high efficiency modules
for amplification and signaling, achieving consumer-grade performance
and ease of use while reducing e-waste (RAEE) occurrence.

\

Moreover, the low-power, low-voltage and high-efficiency components used
allow battery-operated tasks, which could be integrated to the actual
design for further development, making OpenSonora Alpha portable.
